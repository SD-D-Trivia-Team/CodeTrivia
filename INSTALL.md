To install all modules needed, clone the repository, open a terminal, navigate into the top level directory CodeTrivia,
run command "npm install"

Next, run "npm start" and visit localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000 in any browser.

The application should be able to run from there, as the information for GitHub OAuth
and the MongoDB database are provided within the server.js file. 

If there are any questions,
feel free to contact any one of the members.
