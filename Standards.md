# Codetrivia Documented Coding Standards

Harrison Riley, Anthony Bonadies

## Naming Conventions

In regards to how code is written for naming conventions,
names for variables in Javascript should be written generally
in lowerCamelCase unless for other reasons such as predefined 
database variable names. Functions also follow this naming convention.
In regards to classes, any class is written in UpperCamelCase.

## Documentation of functionality

In regards to documenting any functions which are written, each
function should have a section in which it details:
- The function name and variables
- The preconditions that are present before the function is run
- The postconditions or what the function results should be 

## Other conventions

In regards to other conventions, we have:

### File structure

Files should be appropriately named and for each page, the corresponding
files should be separated (i.e. the Quiz page's files should be within the
Quiz folder).

### Commented out code

Code should be as clean as possible, so if team members find any areas with
commented out code they are to clean it out as soon as possible.
