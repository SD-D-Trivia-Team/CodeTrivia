# Codetrivia Development Project

## Developers
 - Anthony Bonadies
 - James Gao
 - Sitong Liu
 - Harrison Riley

## Vision

This project was developed out of the idea of wanting to provide a space
for people to quiz themselves on coding topics such as JavaScript, Python,
and more. The project was primarilly developed using Node.js as well as HTML
with Bootstrap CSS. 

## Installation/Development

The installation notes should be kept in INSTALL.md, but if the notes do not work 
or you need to get in contact with the development team feel free to do so.

## Notes

There are currently no impending notes as of now. If anything major happens within the
development of this application we will let the community know appropriately through
updataing this section of the README.
